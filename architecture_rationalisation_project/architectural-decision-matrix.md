5. **Maintainability** - How easy is it to maintain?
6. **User Impact** - How does it affect user experience?
7. **Future Scalability** - How well does it support future growth?

### Scoring System

- **Score Range**: 1-10 (1 = Poor, 10 = Excellent)
- **Weighting**: Each criterion has a weight based on importance
- **Total Score**: Weighted average of all criteria
- **Decision Threshold**: Minimum score required for consideration
