## Usage Guidelines

### Before Each Test Session

1. **Review previous sessions** for context and patterns
2. **Prepare test environment** with clean browser/console
3. **Set up logging** to capture all relevant information
4. **Define clear objectives** for the session

### During Each Test Session

1. **Document everything** - don't assume you'll remember
2. **Take screenshots** of important console output
3. **Record timing** for performance-sensitive operations
4. **Note unexpected behavior** even if it seems minor

### After Each Test Session

1. **Complete the session template** while memory is fresh
2. **Update pattern recognition** with new findings
3. **Plan next session** based on discoveries
4. **Update project documentation** with new insights

### Between Sessions

1. **Analyze patterns** across multiple sessions
2. **Update risk assessments** based on new findings
3. **Refine test strategies** based on what we're learning
4. **Communicate findings** to project stakeholders
