  - Component state logging at critical points
- **Purpose**: Track complete application initialization flow

### üéØ FAB Framework Files

#### `js/fab/BaseFAB.js`

- **Enhancement**: Added BaseFABLogger system
- **Changes**:
  - Constructor logging with configuration details
  - Initialization step tracking
  - Element creation and DOM manipulation logging
  - State change tracking
- **Purpose**: Monitor FAB lifecycle and DOM operations

#### `js/fab/FABManager.js`

- **Enhancement**: Added FABManagerLogger system
- **Changes**:
  - FAB type registration logging
  - Instance creation tracking with detailed context
  - Error handling with comprehensive state information
  - Performance metrics for FAB operations
- **Purpose**: Track FAB management operations and failures

#### `js/fab/DocsFAB.js`

- **Enhancement**: Added registration logging
- **Changes**:
  - FABManager registration logging
  - Registration success/failure tracking
- **Purpose**: Monitor FAB registration process

#### `js/fab/SidebarToggleFAB.js`

- **Enhancement**: Added registration logging
- **Changes**:
  - FABManager registration logging
  - Registration success/failure tracking
- **Purpose**: Monitor FAB registration process

## Logging Systems Added

### DiagnosticLogger (bootstrap.js)

- **Levels**: verbose, info, warn, error
- **Features**: Timestamped, structured logging with data objects
- **Scope**: Application-wide initialization and execution flow

### BaseFABLogger (BaseFAB.js)

- **Levels**: Single level with component identification
- **Features**: FAB-specific logging with lifecycle tracking
- **Scope**: Individual FAB instance operations

### FABManagerLogger (FABManager.js)

- **Levels**: Single level with component identification
- **Features**: FAB management operations with detailed context
- **Scope**: FAB type registration and instance creation

## Log Output Examples

### Application Initialization

```
üîç [2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z] [INFO] [AppBootstrap]: Starting application initialization
üîç [2025-01-01T12:00:00.001Z] [VERBOSE] [AppBootstrap]: Step 1: Waiting for native features
üîç [2025-01-01T12:00:00.002Z] [VERBOSE] [AppBootstrap]: Step 2: Getting device context
```

### FAB Creation

```
üîç [2025-01-01T12:00:00.100Z] [INFO] [AppBootstrap]: FAB Creation: Starting FAB initialization
üîç [2025-01-01T12:00:00.101Z] [VERBOSE] [AppBootstrap]: FAB Creation: Checking FABManager availability
üîç [2025-01-01T12:00:00.102Z] [INFO] [FABManager]: Creating FAB instance
```

## Cleanup Considerations

### What to Keep

- **Performance timing**: Useful for optimization
- **Error tracking**: Valuable for production debugging
- **State logging**: Helpful for complex debugging scenarios

### What to Remove

- **Verbose execution flow**: Too detailed for production
- **Constructor logging**: Not needed in production
- **DOM manipulation details**: Too granular for production

### Recommended Approach

1. **Keep**: Error logging and performance metrics
2. **Modify**: Reduce verbose logging to info level
3. **Remove**: Constructor and step-by-step execution logging

## Testing Impact

These enhancements enable:

- **Complete visibility** into initialization failures
- **Performance profiling** of each initialization step
- **Detailed error analysis** with context
- **Systematic debugging** of FAB framework issues
