# Introduction

Welcome to WeeWoo Map Friend — a simple web map to explore emergency‑related layers in Victoria.

What you can do:

- Turn layers on/off: 👷 SES, 🏛️ LGA, 🔥 CFA, 🚑 Ambulance, 👮 Police
- Search across all layers to find places quickly
- Show a name label for items you care about (🏷️)
- Emphasise items to highlight them (📢)
- See a 7‑day forecast for active items (🌦️, optional)

How it works:

- Maps run in your browser with Leaflet.js (fast and lightweight)
- A tiny backend (optional) fetches weather data so your API keys are kept safe
- Docs are plain Markdown files rendered in the app and safely sanitized

Tip: If you get lost, press ♻️ Reset to go back to the default view.
