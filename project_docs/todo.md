# Project TODO & Future Enhancements

## Overview

This document tracks planned improvements, enhancements, and technical debt items for the WeeWoo Map Friend project. Items are organized by priority and include implementation details, dependencies, and risk assessments.

## Diagram & Visualization Improvements

### 1. Enhanced ASCII Diagrams (Immediate Priority)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented enhanced ASCII formatting in architecture overview

**What Was Done**:

- Replaced basic ASCII flow with box-drawing characters and clear directional flow
- Improved readability while maintaining ASCII compatibility
- No external dependencies or setup required

**Benefits**:

- Immediate visual improvement
- Better readability for developers
- Maintains version control compatibility
- No build process changes needed

### 2. Mermaid.js Integration (Medium Priority)

**Context**: Discussed during architecture documentation creation as a replacement for ASCII diagrams

**Why We Want This**:

- Professional, publication-ready diagrams
- Text-based format that's version control friendly
- Automatic layout and styling
- Industry standard for technical documentation
- Better support for complex system diagrams

**Implementation Details**:

- Add Mermaid.js library to project
- Convert ASCII diagrams to Mermaid syntax
- Integrate with documentation build process
- Update documentation templates to support Mermaid

**Dependencies**:

- Mermaid.js library (CDN or npm package)
- Documentation build system updates
- Developer training on Mermaid syntax

**Key Risks**:

- **Build Complexity**: Adds another dependency to the build process
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Mermaid syntax
- **Browser Compatibility**: May not work in older browsers (mitigated by fallbacks)
- **Maintenance**: Diagrams become more complex to maintain

**Effort Estimate**:

- **Setup**: 2-3 hours (library integration, build updates)
- **Migration**: 4-6 hours (convert existing diagrams)
- **Testing**: 2-3 hours (cross-browser, build verification)
- **Documentation**: 1-2 hours (update templates, add examples)
- **Total**: 9-14 hours

**Recommended Timeline**: Implement after core documentation structure is complete and stable

- **Migration**: 8-12 hours (convert to UML, create formal models)
- **Testing**: 3-4 hours (build verification, diagram validation)
- **Documentation**: 2-3 hours (UML examples, modeling guidelines)
- **Total**: 17-25 hours

**Recommended Timeline**: Consider after Mermaid.js is stable and team is comfortable with diagram-based documentation
