## üö® **CRITICAL PRE-REFACTOR ACTIONS**

### **1. Backup & Version Control** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**
```bash
# Create dedicated migration branch
git checkout -b feature/es6-migration-phase1
git push -u origin feature/es6-migration-phase1

# Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup/pre-migration-state
git push -u origin backup/pre-migration-state
git checkout feature/es6-migration-phase1
```

### **2. Performance Baselines** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**
```bash
# Run performance baseline tests
npm run test:performance:suite
npm run budget:check

# Capture current performance metrics
npm run test:runtime-health
```

### **3. Test Coverage Baseline** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**
```bash
# Run full test suite to establish baseline
npm run test:coverage

# Run ES6 module tests specifically
npm run test:es6:coverage

# Run legacy tests to ensure they still pass
npm run test:legacy
```

### **4. Legacy Usage Analysis** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**
```bash
# Analyze current legacy usage patterns
npm run analyze:legacy

# Review the generated legacy-usage-analysis.json
# Ensure all legacy patterns are documented
```

## üéØ **MIGRATION START CRITERIA**

### **All of the following must be TRUE before starting:**

1. **‚úÖ Git branches created and pushed**
2. **‚úÖ Performance baselines captured**
3. **‚úÖ Test coverage baseline established**
4. **‚úÖ Legacy usage analysis complete**
5. **‚úÖ Documentation reviewed and approved**
6. **‚úÖ Team prepared and aligned**
7. **‚úÖ ES6 foundation working correctly**
8. **‚úÖ Rollback plan understood**

---

## üöÄ **READY TO START MIGRATION**

### **Phase 1: Critical Bootstrap (Weeks 2-3)**
**Files to migrate:**
1. `js/config.js` ‚Üí `ConfigurationManager.js` (lowest risk, highest reuse)
2. `js/state.js` ‚Üí `StateManager.js` (central state management)
3. `js/preloader.js` ‚Üí `DataLoadingOrchestrator.js` (data loading)
4. `js/bootstrap.js` ‚Üí `ES6Bootstrap.js` (orchestration)

### **Migration Order:**
1. **Week 1:** `config.js` migration
2. **Week 2:** `state.js` migration
3. **Week 3:** `preloader.js` and `bootstrap.js` migration

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All legacy variables have ES6 equivalents
- [ ] All legacy functions have ES6 method equivalents
- [ ] Compatibility layer maintains functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] No broken functionality

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **1. Gradual Migration**
- Migrate one file at a time
- Test thoroughly after each migration
- Maintain compatibility layer throughout
- Don't rush the process

### **2. Testing at Every Step**
- Run tests after each file migration
- Test both legacy and ES6 functionality
- Monitor performance continuously
- Validate user experience

### **3. Communication**
- Report issues immediately
- Document any deviations from plan
- Keep team informed of progress
- Celebrate milestones

### **4. Quality Over Speed**
- Better to be slow and correct than fast and broken
- Take time to understand each file's role
- Preserve well-designed legacy patterns
- Don't break working functionality

---

## üìû **SUPPORT & ESCALATION**

### **If Issues Arise:**
1. **Document the issue** in detail
2. **Check the compatibility layer** first
3. **Review the migration maps** for correct variable names
4. **Test the ES6 modules** individually
5. **Escalate to team** if unable to resolve

### **Rollback Procedure:**
1. **Stop current migration** immediately
2. **Switch to backup branch** if needed
3. **Restore working state** from git
4. **Document what went wrong**
5. **Plan corrective action** before retrying

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ **READY TO START MIGRATION**

**Next Action:** Execute the pre-refactor checklist, then begin Phase 1 migration with `js/config.js`.

**Estimated Timeline:** 8-12 weeks for complete migration
**Risk Level:** Medium (well-planned approach mitigates complexity)
**Success Probability:** High (strong ES6 foundation already in place)
