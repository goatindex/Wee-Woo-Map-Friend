# Context Management

## Current Session Focus
- **Phase**: DI Migration - Interface Contracts Planning
- **Last Completed**: Dependency audit and method call mapping analysis
- **Next Step**: Propose interface contracts plan for DI migration
- **Key Files**: 
  - `di-migration-mapping.md` (407 lines) - Complete dependency analysis
  - `di-migration-project.md` (605 lines) - Migration project plan
  - `ComponentCommunication.js` (860 lines) - Currently open, DI-enabled module

## Context Optimization Strategy
- **Primary**: Use `grep` for targeted searches before reading full files
- **Secondary**: Read specific file sections only when needed
- **Tertiary**: Use `codebase_search` for semantic queries

## Current Task Status
- ‚úÖ Dependency audit completed
- ‚úÖ Method call mapping completed  
- üîÑ Interface contracts planning (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Migration implementation (pending)

## Key Findings Summary
- 66 total modules identified
- 15 modules already DI-enabled (23%)
- 51 modules need migration (77%)
- Critical dependencies: StateManager, MapManager, DeviceManager
- Missing interfaces: IMapManager, IDeviceManager, ILayerManager, etc.
