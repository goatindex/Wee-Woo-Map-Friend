# Go/No-Go Decision Framework - Core Systems Refactor

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis for the go/no-go decision on the Core Systems Refactor project. The analysis covers technical feasibility, resource requirements, risk assessment, and success criteria.

## Current State Analysis

### **System Fragility Issues**
- **Map Loading Failures**: Consistent failures on both local and deployed environments
- **Sidebar Unresponsiveness**: UI components fail to respond to user interactions
- **Bootstrap Cascade Failures**: Single point of failure causes system-wide breakdown
- **State Management Race Conditions**: Components accessing uninitialized data
- **Tight Coupling**: Direct dependencies create cascade failure patterns

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Architectural Debt**: 5+ years of incremental changes without architectural oversight
2. **Synchronous Dependencies**: Blocking operations prevent graceful degradation
3. **Error Propagation**: Errors cascade through tightly coupled components
4. **State Initialization Timing**: Race conditions in component initialization
5. **Legacy Patterns**: Mix of old and new patterns creates inconsistencies

## Proposed Solution Analysis

### **Technical Approach**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Replace direct method calls with event bus
- **Redux Toolkit State Management**: Centralized, predictable state management
- **InversifyJS Dependency Injection**: Type-safe, testable dependency management
