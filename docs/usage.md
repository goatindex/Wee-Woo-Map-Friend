# Using the App

1. Search and toggle

- Use the sidebar search to find items by name
- Turn items on/off in the category lists (polygons and points)

2. Manage “All Active”

- The “All Active” panel shows what you’ve turned on
- For each row you can:
  - 📢 Emphasise: makes the item stand out
  - 🏷️ Show Name: shows a label on the map
  - 🌦️ Weather: shows a 7‑day forecast (for polygon items with coordinates)

3. Reset

- Hit ♻️ to clear search, remove labels/emphasis, collapse sections, and reset the map view
- Use this when you want a clean slate

Note:

- Police data is lazy‑loaded to keep the page fast; the first time you open Police it may take a moment
