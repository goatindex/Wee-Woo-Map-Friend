# Layers & Categories

- 👷 SES Response Areas (polygons)
- 🏛️ Local Government Areas (polygons)
- 🔥 CFA Response Areas (polygons)
- 🚑 Ambulance Stations (points)
- 👮 Police Stations (points, filtered to stations only)

Notes

- Polygons: show a name label by default when turned on; you can toggle labels off in “All Active”
- Points: don’t show labels by default; use 🏷️ in “All Active” to reveal the name
- Performance: polygons render in a dedicated canvas layer; Police is lazy‑loaded to speed up the first paint
