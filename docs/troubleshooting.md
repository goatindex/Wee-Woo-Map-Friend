# Troubleshooting

Having trouble with WeeWoo Map Friend? Here are solutions to common issues:

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Issues

### Map Won't Load or Appears Blank
- **Check your internet connection** - the map tiles need to download from the internet
- **Try refreshing the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- **Clear your browser cache** if the problem persists

### Items Don't Appear When Selected
- **Wait a moment** - some data (especially Police stations) loads in the background
- **Check the map zoom level** - zoom out to see if items are outside your current view
- **Look for loading indicators** in the sidebar

## üîç Search Issues

### Search Returns No Results
- **Check your spelling** - try searching for part of the name instead
- **Try broader terms** - search "Ballarat" instead of "Ballarat Central Police Station"
- **Browse category lists** if search isn't finding what you need

### Search is Slow or Unresponsive
- **Clear your search** and try again with fewer characters
- **Refresh the page** if search becomes completely unresponsive

## üå¶Ô∏è Weather Issues

### Weather Data Not Loading
- **Wait a few seconds** - weather data is fetched from external services
- **Check your internet connection** - weather requires active internet
- **Try a different location** - some areas may have temporary service issues

### Weather Shows Wrong Location
- **This is normal** - weather uses the centre point of areas, which may not match your exact location
- **For polygons** (SES, LGA, CFA areas), weather shows data for the geographical centre of that area

## ‚ö° Performance Issues

### Page Loads Slowly
- **This is normal on first visit** - data is downloaded and cached for faster future visits
- **Police data loads last** to keep the initial experience fast
- **Use a modern browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) for best performance

### Map Feels Sluggish
- **Try turning off some layers** to reduce the load
- **Use the reset button (‚ôªÔ∏è)** to clear everything and start fresh
- **Close other browser tabs** if your computer is running slowly

## üåê Browser Compatibility

### Features Don't Work Properly
- **Use a modern browser** - the app works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Enable JavaScript** - the app won't work without it
- **Disable ad blockers** temporarily if features seem broken

### Display Issues
- **Try zooming your browser** (Ctrl/Cmd + or -) if text is too small or large
- **Check your screen resolution** - the app is designed for desktop and tablet screens

## üìä Data Issues

### Information Seems Outdated
- **This is expected** - emergency service boundaries and station locations change over time
- **The data is sourced from public datasets** which may not be updated immediately
- **Check the "last updated" information** on the main page

### Missing Locations
- **Some locations may not be included** in the public datasets used
- **Try searching for nearby areas** which might include your location
- **Browse the category lists** to see what's available

## üÜò Still Having Problems?

If none of these solutions help:

1. **Try a different browser** to see if it's browser-specific
2. **Clear your browser cache and cookies** for this site
3. **Check if the issue happens on other devices** (phone, tablet, different computer)
4. **Try again later** - there may be temporary service issues

Remember: WeeWoo Map Friend is a hobby project, so some limitations are expected. The app works best for exploring emergency service areas and getting a general understanding of coverage areas rather than for critical operational use.
